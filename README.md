# TI84

A collection of useful math programs written in TI-BASIC for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator.

## Programs

- **ALGB1KIT** - Combines several algebraic functions into one program:
    1. Pythagorean Theorem Solver
    2. Quadratic Formula Solver
    3. Simplify Radical Expressions
    4. List Statistics (Mean, Median, Range)
    5. Geometric Sequence Calculator
    6. Compound Interest Calculator
    7. Discriminant Calculator
- **QUADFORM** - Calculates the roots of quadratic equations using the quadratic formula
- **FACTOR** - Factors polynomials of any degree with any number of terms
- **SEQUENCE** - Determines an arithmetic or geometric sequence from a list of numbers
- **CLEANUP** - Cleans up the calculator by deleting all variables and lists (used internally by other programs)

## Installation
